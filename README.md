# Protests Increase Donations to Federal Political Campaigns

How do protests influence American donation behavior? We provide ev- idence that protests affect an individualâ€™s willingness to donate money to a political campaign. First, we utilize a staggered difference-in-difference design using county, week, and year fixed-effects and find that a protest causes an increase of about 83 individual donations (or roughly $13,000) to federal po- litical campaigns in a county. We also provide evidence that liberal protests increase donations to Democrats and conservative protests increase donations to Republicans. Second, we implement a regression discontinuity design that leverages the random timing of the killing of George Floyd and the subsequent political protests following his death. After the murder of George Floyd, there is an increase of about 43,807 individual-level FEC donations (or approxmi- ately $4,924,787). These findings are robust to various model specifications, window sizes, and additional robustness checks. Overall, our analysis reveals that protests are a significant money generating exercise for candidates.
