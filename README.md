# Protests Increase Donations to Federal Political Campaigns


How do protests influence American donation behavior? We provide evidence that protests affect an individualâ€™s willingness to donate money to political campaigns. First, we implement a regression discontinuity design that leverages the random timing of the killing of George Floyd and the subsequent political protests following his death. After the murder of George Floyd, there is a 48.3 percent increase ($8,052,910) in the total daily amount of individual- level donations. These findings are robust to various model specifications and window sizes. 

Second, we utilize a staggered difference-in-differences design using county, week, and year fixed-effects and find that each additional protest within a county causes an increase of about 97 donations (or roughly $18,000) to federal political campaigns. With this estimated effect size, we extrapolate that protests have generated more than 550 million dollars to federal political campaigns over the last five years. Finally, we provide evidence that liberal protests increase donations to Democrats and conservative protests increase donations to Republicans, which supports the idea that ideological protests relay important mobilizing information. Overall, our analysis reveals that protests are a significant money generating exercise for candidates.
